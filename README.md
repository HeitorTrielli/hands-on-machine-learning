This repository contains my self study on the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems by Aurélien Géron.

Most of the code from the chapters.py are straight from the book, while most of the code from the exercises.py are my own.
